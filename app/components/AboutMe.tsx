          I&apos;m a musician currently pursuing masters degree in viola performance which I&apos;m expecting to finish
          this fall. I&apos;ve been working as a freelance studio and concert artist for the last 5 years. I specialise
          in new music performance - I&apos;ve performed on numerous festivals with ensembles like{" "}

          I got into coding right after finishing my bachelors degree. I found myself missing the more
          &quot;technical&quot; aspects of my personality. After brief consideration of my options I landed on Web
          Development. It quickly proved to be the right choice - I find being able to solve real problems and working
          with visuals very satisfying.

          I&apos;m a fan of sci-fi art, books and movies. I love isometric RPGs (Disco Elysium, Planescape: Torment and
          the like). I&apos;m fascinated by the science of longevity and healthspan. My other interests include
          linguistics, drawing and plant-based cuisine.
