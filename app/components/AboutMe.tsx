          I&apos;m a musician currently pursuing masters degree in viola performance which I&apos;m expecting to finish
          this fall. I&apos;ve been working as a freelance studio and concert artist for the last 5 years. I specialise
          in new music performance - I&apos;ve performed on numerous festivals with ensembles like{" "}

          I got into coding right after finishing my bachelor&apos;s degree. I found myself missing the more
          &quot;technical&quot; aspects of my personality. After brief consideration of my options, I landed on web
          development. It quickly proved to be the right choice - I enjoy solving tangible problems and working with
          visuals a lot. Ever since, I&apos;ve been drawn closer to the world of programming, latest symptom being the
          unshakable desire to learn Rust. Currently, I&apos;m at a point where I feel somewhat ready to contribute to
          commercial solutions, and I&apos;m looking forward to growing my skills in the real world.

          A few words about my other interests: I&apos;m a fan of sci-fi art, books and movies. I love isometric RPGs
          (Disco Elysium, Planescape: Torment and the like). I&apos;m fascinated by the science of longevity (maybe a
          bit of a health nut?). I also dabble in drawing and plant-based cuisine.
