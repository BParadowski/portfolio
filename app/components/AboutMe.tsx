          I'm a musician currently pursuing masters degree in viola performance which I am expecting to finish this
          fall. I've been working as a freelance studio and concert artist for the last 5 years. I specialise in new
          music performance - I've performed on numerous festivals with ensembles like Orkiestra Muzyki Nowej and
          Hashtag Ensemble. For more than 4 years I've been a member of Primuz Chamber Orchestra with which I've
          performed dozens of concerts and recorded filmscores and albums. You can listen to me here.

          I got into coding right after finishing my bachelors degree. I found myself missing the more "technical"
          aspects of my personality. After brief consideration of my option I landed on Web Development. It quickly
          proved to be the right choice - I find solving real problems and working with visuals very satisfying.
