          I'm a musician currently pursuing masters degree in viola performance which I am expecting to finish this
          fall. I've been working as a freelance studio and concert artist for the last 5 years. I specialise in new
          music performance - I've performed on prestigious festivals with ensambles like Orkiestra Muzyki Nowej and
          Hashtag Ensamble. For more than 4 years I've been a member of Primuz Chamber Orchestra with which I've
          performed dozens of concerts and recorded filmscores and albums. You can listen to me here.

          I got into coding right after finishing my bachelors degree. I found myself missing the more "technical"
          aspects of my personality and after consideration of different aspects of IT I landed on Web Development.

          My other interests include good literature and movies (especially sci-fi), isometric RPGs, linguistics,
          science of longevity and plant-based cuisine.
