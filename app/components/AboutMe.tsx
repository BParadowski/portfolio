          I&apos;m a musician pursuing a master&apos;s degree in viola performance which I expect to complete this fall.
          For the past 5 years, I&apos;ve worked as a freelance studio and concert artist, specializing in new music
          performance. I&apos;ve performed at numerous festivals with ensembles such as{" "}

          I got into coding right after finishing my bachelor&apos;s degree. I found myself missing the more
          &quot;technical&quot; aspects of my personality. After brief consideration of my options, I landed on web
          development. It quickly proved to be the right choice - I enjoy solving tangible problems and working with
          visuals a lot. Ever since, I&apos;ve been drawn closer to the world of programming, latest symptom being the
          unshakable desire to learn Rust. Currently, I&apos;m at a point where I feel ready to contribute to commercial
          solutions, and I&apos;m looking forward to growing my skills in the real world.

          When I&apos;m not making music or coding, I relax consuming art, books and movies (especially sci-fi). I love
          playing isometric RPGs (Disco Elysium, Planescape: Torment and the like). I dabble in drawing and painting. My
          other interests include the science of longevity and plant-based cuisine.
